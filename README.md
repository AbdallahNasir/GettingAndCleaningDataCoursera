Getting And Cleaning Data Project
==============================
This repo contains four files:

1. run_analysis.R, which contains script for processing the data sets in the project.

2. tidyData.txt, contains the output of the script above.

3. codeBook.md, describes the output rows.

4. README.md, this file.

Please note that these files and this submission does not imply any results about the real data and does not introduce anything new, only taking avareges for each person by activity and omiting some features.

In order to obtain tidyData.txt again, the run_analysis.R should be modified to point to the location of the desired data, and to output the tidyData in the desired location, then after running the code, the file will be created.

The memory is freed for sure from the used variables to prevent memory leaks.
